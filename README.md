Domains

    1) Regression
        Projects in this domain focus on predicting continuous values.
    2) Classification
        Projects in this domain focus on predicting categorical values.
    3) Deep Learning
        Projects in this domain involve building and training neural networks.
    4) Natural Language Processing
      Projects in this domain involve working with text data and implementing NLP techniques.

Libraries Used
